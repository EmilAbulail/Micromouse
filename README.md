=> movementTest.ino was used to see the robot movement in each direction by modifying H-Bridge pins with 4 cases (forward, reverse, left, right).
=> sensorTest.ino was used to see the sensor's reading by reading the echo values and converting them to cm and then printing these values on the serial monitor.
=> code.ino was the final code that describes our robot behavior depending on the leftHand algorithm
